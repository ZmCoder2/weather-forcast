# Five Day Weather Forecast

## Description

This is a Five Day Weather Dashboard that allows users to search any city in the us to get the current weather data and the following five days weather data. The main card displays the current weather for the city that the user is searching for. Below the main card, displays the following five days weather data. In the main card the user will see the city name, the temperature, wind speed, humidity, and then an icon that displays if it will be cloudy, sunny, raining, snow, and etc.

On the left side of the page, is a search text box that allows the user to type in it to search for a city with a styled search button right underneath. There  is a list of buttons that have city name in them under the seaarch section. (I am still currently working on those to get them to work accordingly).
